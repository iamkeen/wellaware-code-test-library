- Book ISBN numbers are unique. There cannot be two books with the same ISBN number, so an attempt to add a book to a shelf when that ISBN number already exists in the library should fail.
        - check if ISBN already exists in Library
            - if true
                - throw exception
            - else
                - add to library

- Books are only put on the same shelf as other books of the same genre.
- Each shelf can only hold a maximum number of books, specified by the library class member variable.
- When a shelf is full, a new shelf must be created to accommodate another book for that genre.
- Each shelf will have an associated genre and shelf number within the genre. The name of the shelf should be formatted as "Genre - Number". For example, “Science Fiction – 1”, “Science Fiction – 2”, “Science Fiction – 3”, “Cooking - 1”, “Cooking – 2”, “Travel – 1”.
- check book genre and add to appropriate shelf
- check current number of books on appropriate shelf
- if numBooksOnShelf < maxShelfSize
    - add book to shelf
- else
    - create new shelf and increment number in shelf's name

- Books are ordered alphabetically first by author, then title. The first books in the order are placed on that genre’s shelf #1, when that shelf is full the next books in order go on that genre’s shelf #2, etc. When adding a book to a shelf that’s already full, books will get displaced to the next numbered shelf to maintain sort order.
- need to sort books in shelves alphabetically

- Only create the number of shelves necessary for all the books. There should not be any empty shelves in the library
